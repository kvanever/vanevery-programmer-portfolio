# Kevin VanEvery Professional Portfolio

#### This is my professional marketing website highlighting my professional experience in the web industry. Updated 05/27/2016

#### By Kevin VanEvery

## Description

This website details my experience at Matrix and at Epicodus.  It includes links and info to previous projects, a bio section, and a contact form.  This site is an exercise in creating websites using the Bootstrap CSS framework and HTML.  

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your local machine or server
* Open index.html

## Known Bugs

There are no case studies.  Each of the projects listed on the work.html page refers to an empty anchor tag on the "Read the Case Study" link and the associated thumbnail.  Creating child pages but nesting the files in a folder properly and having the navigation work dynamically proved to be more frustrating than helpful.

## Support and contact details

          <p class="lead">
            I was born a Virginian in the suburbs of Washington DC and I go back home for the holidays every year.  Outside of that, I can be more difficult to find.  I grew up living overseas in Athens and New Delhi, son of a State Department employee.  My formative years were spent taking those experiences for granted (I was only a teenager) and playing video games.
          </p>
          <p>
            I attended university at Tulane in New Orleans where I learned about music, sin, Mardi Gras, and hurricanes.  I graduated a semester late because of Katrina with a degree in philosophy and classical history and a lot of drinking stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent a year abroad teaching English as an exchange teacher in Japan before returning to the Washington DC metro area.  I parlayed my liberal arts degree into a tech job as a project manager at a web agency and that was the beginning of my first career as a web consultant and technical project manager.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a certain point, I grew dissatisfied with my lack of technical expertise, so I quit my job, sold my house and all my belongings and now Iâ€™m in Portland studying the Microsoft stack course at Epicodus.  I'll be starting my next adventure at the beginning of 2017.</p>
